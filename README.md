## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for "Electric Vehicle Analysis" by Bharat Software Solutions! This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the electric vehicle (EV) landscape, covering both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Through meticulous data analysis, we've explored various key performance indicators (KPIs) and created insightful visualizations to shed light on the evolving EV market.

## Key Metrics Explored
1. **Total EV Market Size**: Understanding the overall growth trajectory and market dynamics.
2. **Average Electric Range**: Assessing technological advancements and efficiency improvements.
3. **Distribution of BEVs and PHEVs**: Analyzing the market share and trends within different vehicle categories.

## Visualizations
Our analysis is accompanied by a series of interactive charts and graphs, created using Microsoft Excel Version 2021 and Microsoft Power BI Version 2023. Here are some of the visualizations included:
- **Growth Patterns by Model Year**: Revealing historical trends and adoption rates.
- **Regional Adoption Rates**: Identifying geographical variations in EV uptake.
- **Top Manufacturers' Dominance**: Highlighting market leaders and their market share.
- **Eligibility for Incentives**: Illustrating the proportion of EVs eligible for government incentives.
- **Consumer Preferences**: Analyzing the popularity of different EV models among consumers.
